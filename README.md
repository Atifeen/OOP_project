There is a movie theatre named ABC cineplex, which has in total six 
halls. Among them three halls are 3D and other three are 2D. Each 
hall has 60 seats in total, first 30 of them are of premium type and 
the rest 30 are of regular type. Our task is to build a software system 
which will digitalize the ticketing system for this movie theatre.
